Afghan War Casualties

For the 18th anniversary of the Afghan War our group seeks to honor those who have lost their lives during the longest conflict in US history. We will attempt to build an interactive map that shows the toll that this conflict has taken on communities not just in the United States but across the globe. Using a combination of data from sources with fatality information and data sets with city latitudes and longitudes we want to connect the places that individuals come from and where they lost their lives. Ideally the markers will give information on the individuals including their names, age, and service branch. We will build out multiple views based on the years in which the fatalities occurred.
